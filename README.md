# LeetCode
Collection of completed Leet Code projects.

The first class titled "Solution" is my own first successful submission.
There may be a class titled "Solution2." This class is my second submssion with a goal of making the code better in some fashion.
The next class titled "OptimalSolution" is Leet Code's solution. This is not always the "best" solution, but Leet Code explains the logic very well and is worth revisiting.
Any following classes are other's submissions that I want to look back and learn from at a later date.
